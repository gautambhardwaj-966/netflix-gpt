-First we create slice and then we add this reducer in our appStore
-All the Data layer is managed by Redux store
-We use redux store because there is so many slices and data so it becomes easy with redux
-Redux is a state management library.
-Never use console.log in production code(best practice)
-OPENAI KEY API
-Need to install npm open ai(This will giev us helper functions which will help us call ai functions directly)
Redux = Dispatch an action => Reducer function => Update Store(slices) => Selector(Component subscribed to store) => View
